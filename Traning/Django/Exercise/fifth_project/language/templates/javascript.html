<h2>Introduction To Java script</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.

    JavaScript is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed). JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 

    Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.
