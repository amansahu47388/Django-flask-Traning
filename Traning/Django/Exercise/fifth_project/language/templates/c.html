<h2>Introduction To C</h2><br>
<p>
    C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. 

    C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.
    One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.
    C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language. Some of the key features of C include:
